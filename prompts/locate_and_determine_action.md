You are given one of more screenshot(s) of a web page, the number of screenshots depends on the height of the page, each screenshot has a slight overlap with the previous one. please read the instructions and determine the next action to take, use JSON format to return the action. Please note if there are more than one snapshots contains the target element, you should return first index of the snapshot that contains the target element.

Instructions:
```
<%=instruction%>
```

An example of the JSON format is when you need to type "Content" at the location (64, 128) on the 2nd snapshot image:
```
{
    "action": "type",
    "target_image": 2,
    "location_x": 64,
    "location_y": 128, 
    "value": "Content", 
    "comment": "none"
}
```
- `action` is the action to take, it can be one of the following:
    - `click`: click on the element at the given location
    - `type`: type the given text at the given location
    - `navigate`: navigate to the given URL
    - `expectation`: check if the given element is present
    - `unknown`: if you can't perform the given action, or can't determine the element to interact with, return this action.
- `location_x` and `location_y` are the coordinates of the element to click, type or to be expected to check (but if the action is `expectation`, and the element is not present, you should ignore those 2 fields). If the `action` is `navigate` or `unknown`, these fields are not used. 
- `target_image` is the index of the snapshot that contains the target element.
- `value` is only used for the `type`,  `navigate`, `expectation` actions:
    - `type`: the text to type
    - `navigate`: the URL to navigate to
    - `expectation`: set to `true` if the element is present, set to `false` otherwise
- `comment` is used for the `expectation` and `unknown` action:
    - `expectation`: please put a very short explanation of why the expectation is true or false.
    - `unknown`: please put a very short explanation of why you can't perform the given action or determine the element to interact with.
